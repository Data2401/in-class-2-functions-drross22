For our in class assignment today, I didn't set up the template like I've done on the other ones, we're going to try a different way. 
You have the choice to set up your repo as you like, you can either:
1) upload the RMD file into the repo online (use that upload file button)
2) clone the repo into a project and move the RMD into your repository folder on your local machine
3) clone the repo into a project and copy/paste the contents of the repo into a new rmarkdown that you've made inside the folder (this is probably the worst option, to be honest)  

This is a completion grade, so give it your best shot, and feel free to comment on the pull request or let me know if you have any specific questions.
